# Kool

Experimental compiler for the Kool language (a Kotlin-based language - thank you, JetBrains, I love your language and
yours IDEs, tools! S2) written in C# (which I love to use it too!
Thank you, Microsoft!).

> This project is for FUN, LEARNING, and EXPERIMENTING with the knowledge area of

## Goals

- [x] Investigate a parser to play with (using Irony for now);
- [x] Investigate how to parse and roughly generate the AST;
- [x] Investigate how to create partial tests to verify the generated AST;
- [ ] Finish to watch the videos from Immo Landwerth on YouTube about the creation of the Misky programming language.
  That should give me some ideas of how to create the .NET libraries;
- [ ] Define the Kool language;
- [ ] Create a Kool language parser;
- [ ] Transpile to JavaScript (or maybe TypeScript)?
- [ ] Transpile to C# (or maybe generate code directly with Roslyn)?

## The Kool language

Kool is almost the Kotlin language with a few changes in the syntax and, obviously, a smaller set of features. I'm
creating it for fun, I'm a father of a newborn baby (yes, I am not sleeping well by these days!), thus I don't have
enough time to create something better for now...
